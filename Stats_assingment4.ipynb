    "Problem Statement 1: Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table: High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total Female 60 54 46 41 201 Male 40 44 53 57 194 Total 100 98 99 98 395 Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?Null Hypothesis H0 : Gender and education level are independent. Alternative Hypothesis H1 : Gender and education level are dependent."
